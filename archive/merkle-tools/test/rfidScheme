Code to write into RFID tags 

Round 1: 
Hardware - Basic component ID strings stored in EPC
Software (write) - Calculates and stores Merkle tree

A : SDR170318466 	(12 bytes)
B : 3DC027D13824 	(12 bytes)
C : 2DC033D14233 	(12 bytes)
B1: 3DC027D1fake 	(12 bytes)
C1: 2DC033D1fake 	(12 bytes)

Round 2:  
Hardware - Component ID 
Software (write) - Takes the component ID, calculates and stores Merkle tree, and stores proof into RFID tag as well
